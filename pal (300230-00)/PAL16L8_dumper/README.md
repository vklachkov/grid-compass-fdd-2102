This is quick and dirty project
to convert my EEPROM programmer
into PAL/GAL dumper/reversing/research platform


Arduino I2C EEPROM Programmer for SST39SF010A/SST39SF020A/SST39SF040A AT29C010A

This code should be compiled by the Arduino IDE and run on an Arduino UNO.

Code based on:

and Chris Baird’s Python script
