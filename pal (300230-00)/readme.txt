pal16l8.bin - binary reperesentation of 300230-00 it we assume it is
ROM lookup table (similar approach to Commodore PLA address chip).

16L8_pins_bin_dump.jpg - pinout for assmuming it is ROM lookup table

PAL16L8_dumper folder contains arduino source code and schematics for dumper

c_equvalent folder contains Simple C program to generate the same binary file
as pal16l8.bin and for future research
